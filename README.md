Coding isnâ€™t just about lines of code for me. Itâ€™s about solving problems, creating experiences, and making things that matter. Iâ€™m the kind of person who sees coding as a tool to bring ideas to life, whether itâ€™s optimizing a process or designing something that improves peopleâ€™s day-to-day.
